I am a **MD-PhD student in computational neuroscience** based out of University of Alberta, supervised by [Dr. Ivor Cribben](https://apps.ualberta.ca/directory/person/cribben). I'm also a visiting researcher at New York University at the Department of Biostatistics at the School of Global Public Health, supervised by [Dr. Yang Feng](https://yangfeng.hosting.nyu.edu/).

I'm interested in **statistics, machine learning, and neuroscience** broadly. I focus on creating robust methods for, and deriving novel insights from neuroimaging data. I am keenly interested in developing graph/network models for time-varying, multimodal data and using this to drive understanding of cogntive processes and disease mechanisms in the brain.

If you would like to chat, **please reach out** to me at either mondrus[at]ualberta.ca or martin.ondrus[at]nyu.edu.

I also like to run, and if you do too, feel free to [add me on Strava](https://strava.app.link/PXLcaH2kILb)!
